I created this repo to keep copies of all my projects I made while taking CS50 GD.
My [CS50 Certificate](https://certificates.cs50.io/8dfb4f66-9395-47f2-bb5d-274ab3270832.png?size=A4).

CS50 GD is [Harvard University's Introduction to Game development](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/).
This course focuses on developing interactive 2D and 3D games. I studied the design of children's games like Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, and Portal, trying to understand how the video games themselves were implemented. Through lectures and hands-on projects, the course explores the principles of 2D and 3D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using platforms such as Unity and LÖVE 2D, as well as languages ​​such as Lua and C#. By the end of the course, I had programmed several of my own games and gained a deep understanding of the fundamentals of game design and development.

This includes both lab exercices and problem sets.
